Whatever license 1.1		27/02/2014


whatever license is very simple and need only one single sentence to describe everything:

do whatever you want "and remember respect is everything !*"


All the content can be use for any purposes, can be extended, modified, use as a base, or anything else, you just have to give proper credit.
Any purpose include commercial use as well as private project.
Content can be used as-is, modified, tuned, tweaked, used for another purpose than it has been initially designed for, included in other project, disassembled and use partially.


Content include all text material, textures, pictures, templates, 3D models in any format, Unity scene, source code or anything else.

EXCEPTION: evil companies are not welcome here and should not, under any condition, use the licensed content for any purpose, even private !
These companies include: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple, Samsung.

This (black)list is subject to change in the future, but removal of your company is not even possible in your craziest dream.

Final note: using licensed content doesn't mean at all you have to release them under the same license (remember the infamous "radioactive" GPL crazy debate and battle).
